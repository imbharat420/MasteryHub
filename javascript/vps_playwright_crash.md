solution for chrome automation crash nginx server and vps
If you are using Playwright to automate Chrome and you are experiencing crashes on your NGINX server or VPS, there are a few things you can try to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure you are using the latest version of Playwright and Chrome. Outdated versions of these tools may have bugs that can cause crashes.

2. Check the logs for any error messages or stack traces that may help you identify the cause of the crash.

3. Increase the amount of memory available to Chrome by using the --remote-debugging-port flag when launching Chrome. For example:

```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  // Launch Chrome with increased memory
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    args: ['--remote-debugging-port=9222', '--js-flags=--max_old_space_size=4096']
  });

  // ...
})();
```

4. Limit the number of concurrent Chrome instances that Playwright launches by setting the concurrency option when launching Chrome. For 
```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  // Launch Chrome with limited concurrency
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    concurrency: 1
  });

  // ...
})();

```

5. Use the --no-sandbox flag when launching Chrome to disable the sandbox that Chrome uses to isolate web pages from each other and from the system. This may help prevent crashes caused by sandbox-related issues, but it may also reduce the security of your automation scripts.
