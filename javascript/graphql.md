**Give a beginner docs about graphql**


GraphQL is a query language for your API. It was developed by Facebook and is often used as an alternative to REST APIs.

Here are some key concepts to understand when learning about GraphQL:

-Schema: The schema defines the structure of your data and the operations that can be performed on it. It is written in the GraphQL language and is used to validate and execute queries.

-Queries: Queries are used to request data from the API. They are written in the GraphQL language and specify the fields you want to retrieve.

-Mutations: Mutations are used to modify data in the API. They are written in the GraphQL language and specify the fields you want to change and the new values for those fields.

-Resolvers: Resolvers are functions that are responsible for populating the data for a field in a GraphQL query. They are executed when a query is sent to the API.

-Types: Types are used to define the shape of your data. They can be scalar types (e.g. Int, String) or custom types that you define in your schema.

-Arguments: Arguments are used to specify additional information in a query or mutation. They can be used to filter data or specify the input for a mutation.

To get started with GraphQL, you'll need to define a schema for your API and then write queries and mutations to request and modify data. You can use a library like graphql-yoga or apollo-server to set up a GraphQL server in your backend application.
