nodejs get all server configuration and server running time and head memory and buffer

There are several ways to get information about the server configuration and runtime in Node.js.

To get information about the current Node.js process, you can use the process object, which is a global object in Node.js. The process object contains information about the current process, including the version of Node.js, the arguments passed to the process, and the current working directory.

Here is an example of how you can use the process object to get information about the current Node.js process:

```js
console.log(`Node.js version: ${process.version}`);
console.log(`Process arguments: ${process.argv}`);
console.log(`Current working directory: ${process.cwd()}`);
To get information about the system and hardware, you can use the os module, which provides APIs for interacting with the operating system. The os module provides information about the system's 
```
CPU, memory, and network interfaces.

Here is an example of how you can use the os module to get information about the system and hardware:

```js
const os = require('os');

console.log(`System uptime: ${os.uptime()} seconds`);
console.log(`Total memory: ${os.totalmem()} bytes`);
console.log(`Free memory: ${os.freemem()} bytes`);
console.log(`CPU architecture: ${os.arch()}`);
console.log(`CPU cores: ${os.cpus().length}`);
console.log(`Network interfaces: ${JSON.stringify(os.networkInterfaces())}`);
```
To get information about the running Node.js server, you can use the process.memoryUsage method to get the current memory usage of the process, and the process.hrtime method to get the current high-resolution real time in a [seconds, nanoseconds] tuple Array.

Here is an example of how you can use these methods to get information about the running Node.js server:

```js
console.log(`Memory usage: ${JSON.stringify(process.memoryUsage())}`);
console.log(`Server uptime: ${process.hrtime(startTime)[0]} seconds`);
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
