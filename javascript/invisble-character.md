To generate zero-width characters in JavaScript, you can use the `String.fromCharCode` method to convert the Unicode code point of the character to a string.

For example, to generate a zero-width space character (`U+200B`), you can use the following code:

```js
const zeroWidthSpace = String.fromCharCode(0x200B);
```

To generate a zero-width non-joiner character (`U+200C`), you can use the following code:


```js
const zeroWidthNonJoiner = String.fromCharCode(0x200C);
```

To generate a zero-width joiner character (`U+200D`), you can use the following code:


```js
const zeroWidthJoiner = String.fromCharCode(0x200D);
```
