write observable stream flow in javascript
An observable stream in JavaScript is a pattern that allows you to observe and react to events or data as they are emitted over time. Here is an example of how you might create and use an observable stream in JavaScript:

```js
const { Observable } = require('rxjs');

const stream$ = new Observable(subscriber => {
  // Emit a value every second
  setInterval(() => {
    subscriber.next('Hello');
  }, 1000);
});
```
// Subscribe to the stream and log each value as it is emitted
stream$.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
In this example, we are using the RxJS library to create an observable stream that emits the string "Hello" every second. We are then subscribing to the stream and logging each value as it is emitted.

Observable streams can be very powerful and can be used to model a wide range of real-time data sources, such as user input, network requests, or changes to a database.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
