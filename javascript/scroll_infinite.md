write web work for fetch infinite data on infinite  scroll to end of page
Here is an example of how you might use a web worker to fetch infinite data on an infinite scroll to the end of a page:

```js
// This code should be placed in a separate file and loaded as a web worker

let page = 1;

self.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  if (self.scrollY + self.innerHeight >= self.scrollHeight) {
    // The user has scrolled to the end of the page
    fetch(`/api/data?page=${page}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        // Do something with the data
        page++;
      });
  }
});

```

In this example, we are using the scroll event to detect when the user has scrolled to the end of the page. When this happens, we are using the fetch function to send a request to an API to retrieve some data. We are also using a variable called page to keep track of which page of data we are on, and we are incrementing it each time we fetch new data.

This allows us to implement an infinite scroll, as we are continuously fetching new data as the user scrolls to the end of the page. You can then process the data as needed and do something with it.

Web workers are a useful tool for offloading CPU-intensive tasks to a separate thread, which can help improve the performance of your application. They are especially useful for tasks that involve fetching data, as they can help prevent the main thread from being blocked while the data is being retrieved.
