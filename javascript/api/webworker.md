Sure! Here's an example of how you can use a base64 encoded file in a web worker:

1.  Create a file called `worker.js` with the following content:

Copy code

```js
self.addEventListener("message", event => {
  // Do something with the base64 encoded file in the worker
  const base64 = event.data;
  // Decode the base64 encoded file and convert to ArrayBuffer
  const binaryString = atob(base64);
  const len = binaryString.length;
  const bytes = new Uint8Array(len);
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    bytes[i] = binaryString.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  // Perform some operations on the ArrayBuffer, then post the result back to the main thread
  const result = someFunction(bytes.buffer);
  self.postMessage(result);
});
```

2.  Then in the main thread (typically in the JavaScript file that runs in the browser), you can create an instance of the web worker and post the base64 encoded file to it:

Copy code

```js
const base64 = await readFile(file);
const worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.postMessage(base64);

worker.onmessage = event => {
  // Do something with the result returned by the worker
  console.log(event.data);
};
```

In this example, the web worker decodes the base64 encoded file into an ArrayBuffer, performs some operations on it using the `someFunction()` function, and then posts the result back to the main thread.

You should also note that web worker have their own execution environment, so the `worker.js` script will not have access to the main script and global scope.
