The AbortController is a JavaScript object that allows you to cancel an ongoing operation, such as an HTTP request, before it completes. It's part of the Fetch API and can be used in conjunction with the `fetch()` function to abort a request.

Here's an example of how you might use the AbortController to cancel an HTTP request:

Copy code

```js
// Create an AbortController and get the associated AbortSignal
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

// Make an HTTP request using the fetch() function and pass the AbortSignal
fetch("/data", { signal })
  .then(response => {
    // Process the response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    if (error.name === "AbortError") {
      console.log("Request was cancelled");
    }
  });

// Cancel the request after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  controller.abort();
}, 5000);
```

In this example, the code creates an AbortController and gets the associated AbortSignal. It then makes an HTTP request using the `fetch()` function and passes the AbortSignal as an option. The `fetch()` function returns a Promise, which is rejected with an `AbortError` if the request is cancelled. The code then cancels the request after 5 seconds using the `abort()` method on the AbortController.
