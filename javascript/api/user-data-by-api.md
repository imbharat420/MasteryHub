There are several browser APIs that allow web developers to gather data about a user's device. However, it is important to use these APIs responsibly and only collect the data that is necessary for the functioning of the website or app.

Here are some examples of browser APIs that can be used to gather data about a user's device:

1.  Navigator API: This API provides information about the user's browser and device, such as the type and version of the browser, the language preference, and the type and version of the operating system.
2.  Screen API: This API provides information about the user's display, such as the screen resolution and color depth.
3.  Geolocation API: This API allows a website to request the user's current location, with the user's consent. It can be used to provide location-specific information or services.
4.  DeviceOrientation API: This API allows a website to access the user's device orientation, such as the pitch, roll, and yaw of the device.
5.  MediaDevices API: This API allows a website to access the user's audio and video input devices, such as microphones and cameras.

It is important to note that the use of these APIs may require the user's consent, and the user may have the option to block or limit the data that is collected. As a web developer, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are using these APIs in a transparent and respectful manner, and that you are only collecting the data that is necessary for the functioning of your website or app.
