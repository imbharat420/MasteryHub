The Prioritized Task Scheduling API (also known as the Scheduling API or the Task Scheduling API) is a browser API that allows web developers to prioritize and schedule tasks in JavaScript. This can be useful for optimizing the performance of web apps by ensuring that important tasks are executed in a timely manner, while less important tasks are executed when there is spare capacity.

Here's an example of how you might use the Prioritized Task Scheduling API to optimize the performance of a JavaScript app:

Copy code

```js
// Define a task that needs to be executed as soon as possible
function importantTask() {
  console.log("Important task executed");
}

// Define a task that can be executed at a lower priority
function lessImportantTask() {
  console.log("Less important task executed");
}

// Use the schedule() method to schedule the important task with the highest priority
scheduler.schedule(importantTask, { priority: "high" });

// Use the schedule() method to schedule the less important task with a lower priority
scheduler.schedule(lessImportantTask, { priority: "low" });
```

In this example, the `importantTask` function is scheduled with the highest priority using the `'high'` value for the `priority` option. The `lessImportantTask` function is scheduled with a lower priority using the `'low'` value for the `priority` option. This means that the `importantTask` function will be executed as soon as possible, while the `lessImportantTask` function will be executed when there is spare capacity.

The Prioritized Task Scheduling API is not widely supported at the moment, so you should check for its availability before using it.
