The `navigator.xr` property is an experimental technology that provides access to the WebXR Device API, which allows web apps to access virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. The `navigator.xr` property is an instance of the `XR` interface, which provides methods and properties for interacting with VR and AR devices.

Here is an example of how to use the `navigator.xr` property to check if a VR or AR device is available and request a session:

Copy code

```js
if ("xr" in navigator) {
  // Check if VR or AR is supported
  navigator.xr.isSessionSupported("immersive-vr").then(function (supported) {
    if (supported) {
      // Request a VR session
      navigator.xr.requestSession("immersive-vr").then(function (session) {
        console.log("VR session granted");
        // Use the VR session
      });
    } else {
      console.log("VR not supported");
    }
  });
} else {
  console.log("WebXR not supported");
}
```

In this example, the `navigator.xr.isSessionSupported` method is used to check if immersive VR is supported, and the `navigator.xr.requestSession` method is used to request a VR session if it is supported. If immersive VR is not supported, a message is logged to the console.

Note that the `navigator.xr` property and the WebXR Device API are experimental technologies and are not widely supported in browsers. You should check for support before using these technologies in your web app.
