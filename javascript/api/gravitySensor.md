The GravitySensor interface is a web platform API that provides access to the gravity sensor of a device, which measures the acceleration due to gravity in three dimensions (x, y, and z). It is often used in combination with other sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope, to provide more accurate information about the orientation and movement of a device.

Here is an example of how to use the GravitySensor interface to access the gravity data in a web page:

Copy code

```js
if ("GravitySensor" in window) {
  const sensor = new GravitySensor();

  sensor.addEventListener("reading", () => {
    console.log(sensor.x); // x-axis acceleration in m/s^2
    console.log(sensor.y); // y-axis acceleration in m/s^2
    console.log(sensor.z); // z-axis acceleration in m/s^2
  });

  sensor.start();
} else {
  console.log("GravitySensor is not supported");
}
```

In this example, a new `GravitySensor` object is created, and an event listener is added to listen for `reading` events. The `reading` event is fired whenever the sensor's data is updated, and the `x`, `y`, and `z` properties of the `GravitySensor` object contain the current acceleration in the corresponding dimension.

Note that the GravitySensor interface is an experimental technology and is not widely supported in browsers. You should check for support before using this interface in your web app.
