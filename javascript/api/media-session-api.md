The Media Session API is a browser API that allows web apps to provide media metadata and control media playback on the user's device. Here's an example of how you might use the Media Session API to control media playback:

Copy code

```js
// Set the media metadata
navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({
  title: "Song Title",
  artist: "Song Artist",
  album: "Song Album",
  artwork: [
    { src: "/cover-art.jpg", sizes: "128x128", type: "image/jpeg" },
    { src: "/cover-art-2x.jpg", sizes: "256x256", type: "image/jpeg" },
  ],
});

// Set the media actions
navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler("play", () => {
  console.log("Play action triggered");
});
navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler("pause", () => {
  console.log("Pause action triggered");
});
navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler("seekbackward", () => {
  console.log("Seek backward action triggered");
});
navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler("seekforward", () => {
  console.log("Seek forward action triggered");
});
```

In this example, the code uses the metadata property to set the media metadata, including the title, artist, album, and artwork. It also uses the setActionHandler() method to set up handlers for the play, pause, seekbackward, and seekforward actions. These handlers will be called when the user triggers the respective actions, such as by clicking the play/pause button on their device.

You can use the Media Session API in conjunction with other APIs, such as the Audio API or the Media Source Extensions API, to control media playback and provide a seamless media experience for the user.
