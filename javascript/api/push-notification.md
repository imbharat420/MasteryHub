To add push notifications to a React.js app, you will need to use the Web Push API and a push notification service such as Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you will need to follow:

1.  Set up a push notification service, such as FCM, and obtain the necessary credentials (e.g. a server key).
2.  In your React.js app, use the `navigator.serviceWorker.register()` method to register a service worker that will handle push notifications.
3.  Use the `Notification.requestPermission()` method to request permission from the user to send push notifications.
4.  If the user grants permission, use the `PushManager.subscribe()` method to subscribe the user to push notifications and obtain a subscription object.
5.  Send the subscription object to your server, which will use it to send push notifications to the user through the push notification service (e.g. FCM).

Here's an example of how you might implement push notifications in a React.js app using FCM:

Copy code

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  // Set up the state for the push notification subscription
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null);

  // Set up the state for the push notification permission
  const [permission, setPermission] = useState(null);

  // Set up the state for the service worker registration
  const [registration, setRegistration] = useState(null);

  // Use the useEffect hook to register the service worker
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the service worker API is supported
    if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
      // Register the service worker
      navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service-worker.js").then(reg => {
        setRegistration(reg);
      });
    }
  }, []);

  // Use the useEffect hook to request permission to send push notifications
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the Notification API is supported and the service worker is registered
    if (Notification.permission !== "denied" && registration) {
      // Request permission to send push notifications
      Notification.requestPermission().then(result => {
        setPermission(result);
      });
    }
  }, [registration]);

  // Use the useEffect hook to subscribe the user to push notifications
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the PushManager API is supported and the user has granted permission to send push notifications
    if (permission === "granted" && registration) {
      // Subscribe the user to push notifications
      registration.pushManager
        .subscribe({
          userVisibleOnly: true,
        })
        .then(sub => {
          setSubscription(sub);
        });
    }
  }, [permission, registration]);

  // Send the subscription object to your server to enable push notifications
  useEffect(() => {
    if (subscription) {
      // Send the subscription object to your server
      fetch("/subscribe", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify(subscription),
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
      });
    }
  }, [subscription]);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display a message depending on the push notification permission */}
      {permission === "granted"
        ? "Push notifications are enabled"
        : "Push notifications are disabled"}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This code will display a message indicating whether push notifications are enabled or disabled, depending on the value of the `permission` state variable. If the user has granted permission to send push notifications, the message will say "Push notifications are enabled". If the user has denied permission or has not yet been prompted for permission, the message will say "Push notifications are disabled".
