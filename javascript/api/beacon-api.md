The Beacon API is a browser API that allows web apps to send small amounts of data to servers, even when the app is not active. You can use it to send information about various browser APIs, such as the Battery API, the Background Tasks API, the Bluetooth API, the Media Session API, and the Network Information API.

Here's an example of how you might use the Beacon API to send information about the Battery API and the Background Tasks API:

Copy code

```js
// Check if the Beacon API is supported
if ("sendBeacon" in navigator) {
  // Set up the data to be sent
  const data = new FormData();

  // Send information about the Battery API
  if ("getBattery" in navigator) {
    data.append("battery_api", "supported");
  } else {
    data.append("battery_api", "not_supported");
  }

  // Send information about the Background Tasks API
  if ("backgroundTasks" in navigator) {
    data.append("background_tasks_api", "supported");
  } else {
    data.append("background_tasks_api", "not_supported");
  }

  // Send the data to the server using the sendBeacon() method
  navigator
    .sendBeacon("/beacon", data)
    .then(response => {
      console.log("Beacon sent:", response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error("Beacon error:", error);
    });
} else {
  console.warn("Beacon API not supported");
}
```

In this example, the code sets up the data to be sent using the `FormData` object and appends fields for the Battery API and the Background Tasks API. It then uses the `sendBeacon()` method to send the data to the server. The `sendBeacon()` method returns a Promise that resolves with a boolean indicating whether the data was sent successfully, or rejects with an error if there was a problem.

You can use a similar approach to send information about other APIs, such as the Bluetooth API, the Media Session API, and the Network Information API.
