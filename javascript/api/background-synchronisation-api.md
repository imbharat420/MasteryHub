The Background Sync API is a browser API that allows web apps to defer actions until the user has stable connectivity. This can be useful for ensuring that actions such as sending a form submission or saving data are completed, even if the user's device is offline or has a poor connection.

Here's an example of how you might use the Background Sync API to send a form submission when the user has stable connectivity:

Copy code

```js
// Check if the Background Sync API is supported
if ("sync" in navigator) {
  // Register the sync event and pass it a tag
  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(registration => {
    registration.sync.register("form-submission").then(event => {
      console.log("Sync event registered:", event);
    });
  });
} else {
  console.warn("Background Sync API not supported");
}

// When the form is submitted, store the data in the IndexedDB database
form.addEventListener("submit", event => {
  event.preventDefault();
  storeFormData(form).then(() => {
    console.log("Form data stored");
  });
});

// In the Service Worker, listen for the sync event and send the form data
self.addEventListener("sync", event => {
  if (event.tag === "form-submission") {
    event.waitUntil(
      sendFormData().then(() => {
        console.log("Form data sent");
      })
    );
  }
});
```

In this example, the code registers the `sync` event and passes it a tag called `form-submission` when the form is submitted. The data is stored in the IndexedDB database. The Service Worker listens for the `sync` event and sends the form data when the event is triggered. The `waitUntil()` method is used to ensure that the form data is sent before the sync event is completed.
