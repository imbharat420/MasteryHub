The File and Directory Entries API is a web platform API that allows web apps to read and write files and directories on the user's local device. It is designed to provide a modern and performant API for web apps to access files and directories, and is intended to replace the older File System API.

Here is an example of how to use the File and Directory Entries API to read the contents of a directory:

Copy code

```js
async function readDirectory() {
  // Get a reference to the directory to read
  const directory = await window.showDirectoryPicker();

  // Create a FileSystemDirectoryReader to read the contents of the directory
  const reader = directory.createReader();

  // Read the contents of the directory
  const entries = await reader.readEntries();

  // Loop through the entries and display their names
  for (const entry of entries) {
    console.log(entry.name);
  }
}
```

This example uses the `showDirectoryPicker` method to allow the user to select a directory to read, and then uses the `createReader` method to create a `FileSystemDirectoryReader` object to read the contents of the directory. The `readEntries` method is then used to read the entries in the directory, and the names of the entries are displayed using a loop.

Note that the File and Directory Entries API is supported only in modern browsers, and is not available in older browsers. You should check for support before using this API in your web app.
