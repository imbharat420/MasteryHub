The Network Information API is a browser API that allows web apps to access information about the user's network connection, such as the type of connection (e.g. WiFi, cellular, etc.), the effective connection type (e.g. 4G, 3G, etc.), and the downlink speed.

You can use the Network Information API to change the video stream that is displayed to the user based on their network connection. For example, you might want to use a lower quality stream for users with a slower or more expensive connection, and a higher quality stream for users with a faster or cheaper connection.

Here's an example of how you might use the Network Information API to change the video stream based on the user's network connection:

Copy code

```js
const videoElement = document.getElementById("video");

function updateVideoSource() {
  // Get the effective connection type from the Network Information API
  const connectionType = navigator.connection.effectiveType;

  // Choose the appropriate video source based on the connection type
  let videoSource;
  if (connectionType === "4g") {
    videoSource = "high-quality.mp4";
  } else if (connectionType === "3g") {
    videoSource = "medium-quality.mp4";
  } else {
    videoSource = "low-quality.mp4";
  }

  // Update the video element's source
  videoElement.src = videoSource;
}

// Use the change event to update the video source when the connection type changes
navigator.connection.addEventListener("change", updateVideoSource);

// Update the video source when the page loads
updateVideoSource();
```

In this example, the code gets the effective connection type from the Network Information API and chooses the appropriate video source based on the connection type. It then updates the `src` attribute of the `video` element with the selected video source. The code also sets up an event listener for the `change` event, which is triggered when the connection type changes, to update the video source as needed.
