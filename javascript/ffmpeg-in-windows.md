**How to run ffmpeg in window**

To run FFmpeg in Windows, you will need to install it first. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1.  Download the FFmpeg binary file for Windows from the official website ([https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)). You will see a list of available builds for different architectures and operating systems. Choose the build that is appropriate for your system.
    
2.  Once the download is complete, open the downloaded file to start the installation process. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.
    
3.  After the installation is complete, you can open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the folder where you installed FFmpeg.
    
4.  To run FFmpeg, enter the following command:
    

Copy code

`ffmpeg [options] [input_file] [output_file]` 

Replace `[options]` with the desired FFmpeg options, `[input_file]` with the path to the input file, and `[output_file]` with the path to the output file.

For example, to convert an MP4 file to a WEBM file, you can use the following command:

Copy code

`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.webm` 

You can find more information about FFmpeg and its options by consulting the FFmpeg documentation ([https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html](https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html)).
