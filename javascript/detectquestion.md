There are several libraries that you can use to detect questions in a sentence using Node.js. Some options include:

1.  `natural`: This is a natural language processing library for Node.js that provides various NLP tools, including a function for detecting whether a sentence is a question. To use it, you can install the library using `npm install natural`, and then use the `isQuestion` method:

Copy code

```js
const natural = require("natural");

console.log(natural.Sentence.isQuestion("Is this a question?")); // true
console.log(natural.Sentence.isQuestion("This is not a question.")); // false
```

2.  `regex-sentence-parser`: This is a library that uses regular expressions to parse and classify sentences. It includes a function for detecting whether a sentence is a question. To use it, you can install the library using `npm install regex-sentence-parser`, and then use the `isQuestion` method:

Copy code

```js
const { isQuestion } = require("regex-sentence-parser");

console.log(isQuestion("Is this a question?")); // true
console.log(isQuestion("This is not a question.")); // false
```

3.  `qtype`: This is a library that uses machine learning to classify the type of a question (e.g. "yes/no", "wh-question", etc.). To use it, you can install the library using `npm install qtype`, and then use the `classify` method:

Copy code

```js
const qtype = require("qtype");

console.log(qtype.classify("Is this a question?")); // 'yes/no'
console.log(qtype.classify("What is your name?")); // 'wh-question
```

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions.
