**In browser how to capture cursor to show on realtime to peer connection javascript**

To capture the cursor and display it in real-time on a peer connection using JavaScript, you will need to use the `getUserMedia()` method to access the user's webcam and display the video stream in a `video` element on the page. Then, you can use the `Canvas` API to draw the cursor on top of the video stream in real-time.

Here is an example of how you can do this:

Copy code

```js
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true}).then(function(stream) {
  var video = document.getElementById('video');
  video.srcObject = stream;

  var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  video.addEventListener('mousemove', function(event) {
    // Clear the canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    // Draw the cursor on the canvas
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(event.offsetX, event.offsetY, 10, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    ctx.fill();
  });
});` 
```
This code will capture the user's webcam and display it in a `video` element with the ID "video". It will also listen for mouse movement events on the video element, and use the `Canvas` API to draw a circle at the cursor's current position on the canvas element with the ID "canvas".

To share this stream with a peer connection, you will need to use a WebRTC library such as `WebRTC` or `PeerJS`. You can then use the peer connection to send the video and cursor data to the other peer.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
