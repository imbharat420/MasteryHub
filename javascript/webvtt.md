WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) is a file format that is used to add captions, subtitles, and other text tracks to video content. To add a WebVTT file to a video, you can use the `<track>` element in HTML.

Here's an example of how you can add a WebVTT file to a video in an HTML page:

Copy code

```js
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
```

This code will add the captions in the `captions.vtt` file to the video, and display them as captions when the user plays the video. The `kind` attribute specifies the type of text track (in this case, "captions"), and the `srclang` attribute specifies the language of the text track (in this case, "en" for English). The `label` attribute specifies a label for the text track that will be displayed to the user.

You can also use JavaScript to add a WebVTT file to a video dynamically, by creating a `track` element and appending it to the `video` element. Here's an example of how you can do this:

Copy code

```js
const videoElement = document.getElementById("video");
const trackElement = document.createElement("track");
trackElement.src = "captions.vtt";
trackElement.kind = "captions";
trackElement.srclang = "en";
trackElement.label = "English";
videoElement.appendChild(trackElement);
```

This code will create a `track` element for the `captions.vtt` file and add it to the `video` element, adding the captions to the video.
