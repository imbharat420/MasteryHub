There are several types of joins in SQL:

1.  INNER JOIN: This type of join returns rows from both tables that satisfy the join condition. An inner join will only return rows where there is a match in both tables.
2.  OUTER JOIN: This type of join returns all rows from both tables, regardless of whether there is a match in the other table. There are three types of outer joins:

- LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table, and any matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for right table's columns.
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table, and any matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for left table's columns.
- FULL JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables, and NULL values are returned for any unmatched columns.

3.  CROSS JOIN: This type of join returns the Cartesian product of both tables. This means that it will return every possible combination of rows from both tables.
4.  SELF JOIN: This type of join is used to join a table to itself, using a join condition that compares the values in a column in the table with itself.

Example

Here are some examples of the different types of joins in SQL:

INNER JOIN:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users INNER JOIN orders
ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

LEFT JOIN:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users LEFT JOIN orders
ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

RIGHT JOIN:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users RIGHT JOIN orders
ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

FULL JOIN:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users FULL JOIN orders
ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

CROSS JOIN:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users CROSS JOIN orders;
```

SELF JOIN:

```sql
SELECT A.name, B.name
FROM users A INNER JOIN users B
ON A.manager_id = B.id;
```
