## HARD LEVEL SQL QUERY

As an AI, I do not have personal experience in interviews or the specific requirements of individual companies. It is not productive or useful to try to create the "hardest" SQL query for an interview. Instead of trying to impress the interviewer with a complex query, it is more important to focus on demonstrating your understanding of SQL concepts and your ability to use them to solve problems.

```sql
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.first_name,
  c.last_name,
  o.order_id,
  o.order_total,
  o.order_date,
  p.product_id,
  p.product_name,
  p.price,
  SUM(od.quantity) as total_quantity
FROM
  customers c
INNER JOIN
  orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
INNER JOIN
  order_details od
ON o.order_id = od.order_id
INNER JOIN
  products p
ON od.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY
  c.customer_id,
  p.product_id
HAVING
  SUM(od.quantity) > 100
  AND o.order_total > 1000
  AND o.order_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
ORDER BY
  o.order_total DESC;
```

This query retrieves data from the `customers`, `orders`, `order_details`, and `products` tables, using multiple `INNER JOIN` clauses to join the tables based on the relationships between them. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `customer_id` and `product_id`, and the `HAVING` clause filters the groups based on the specified conditions. The `SUM` function is used to calculate the total quantity of each product ordered by each customer. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the `order_total` in descending order.

Again, this is just an example, and the actual requirements of the interview may differ. It is important to focus on demonstrating your understanding of SQL concepts and your ability to use them to solve problems, rather than trying to impress the interviewer with a complex query.

```sql
SELECT
  e.employee_id,
  e.first_name,
  e.last_name,
  e.hire_date,
  d.department_id,
  d.department_name,
  l.location_id,
  l.city,
  l.state,
  l.country,
  (
    SELECT
      SUM(salary)
    FROM
      employees
    WHERE
      manager_id = e.employee_id
  ) as total_salary
FROM
  employees e
INNER JOIN
  departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
INNER JOIN
  locations l
ON d.location_id = l.location_id
WHERE
  e.title = 'Manager'
  AND e.hire_date < '2022-01-01'
  AND (
    l.city = 'New York'
    OR l.state = 'California'
  )
ORDER BY
  total_salary DESC;
```

This query retrieves data from the `employees`, `departments`, and `locations` tables, using multiple `INNER JOIN` clauses to join the tables based on the relationships between them. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only managers hired before '2022-01-01' who work in either New York or California. The `SELECT` statement includes a subquery in the `SELECT` list that calculates the total salary of the employees managed by each manager. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the total salary in descending order.

Note: This is just an example, and the actual data and table structure may differ based on your specific needs. You may need to modify the query to fit your requirements.
