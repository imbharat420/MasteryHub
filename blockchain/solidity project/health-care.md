Healthcare Insurance

DESCRIPTION

_Insta-Health_, a healthcare organization, has a new project that will use Blockchain to improve and automate its health insurance process.

You must develop a business network through which patients can opt for health insurance from  _Insta- Health_. Proceed with the following design process:

**Design the Model:**

**Participants:**

The patientâ€™s role involves opting for health insurance from the insurance provider, booking an appointment, paying the consultation charges, and placing the order for the prescribed medicine.

  
The nurse checks vital signs like blood pressure and body temperature. The clerk confirms the appointment. The pharmacy ships the medicine the patient orders. The insurance provider approves the new insurance request by paying the consultation fee for the patient.
