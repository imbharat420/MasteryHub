Here is a list of some common Artisan commands that you can use to create the various components of a Laravel application:

- `php artisan make:controller`: Creates a new controller class.
- `php artisan make:model`: Creates a new model class.
- `php artisan make:migration`: Creates a new database migration.
- `php artisan make:seeder`: Creates a new database seeder class.
- `php artisan make:factory`: Creates a new database factory class.
- `php artisan make:middleware`: Creates a new middleware class.
- `php artisan make:request`: Creates a new request class.

You can also use these commands to generate other types of classes, such as console commands, events, listeners, and notifications.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
