In a Laravel application, a model represents a single entity or object in your application. For example, you might have a `User` model that represents a user in your application. Models are typically used to interact with your application's database and perform tasks such as retrieving data, inserting data, updating data, and deleting data.

On the other hand, a migration in Laravel is a PHP script that is used to create or modify the structure of your application's database. Migrations are typically used to create tables, add columns to tables, and make other changes to the structure of your database.

Here's an example of a model in Laravel:

Copy code

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model {
//
}
```

And here's an example of a migration in Laravel:

Copy code

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateUsersTable extends Migration {
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up() {
        Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->string('email')->unique();
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down() {
        Schema::dropIfExists('users');
    }
}
```

I hope this helps clarify the difference between models and migrations in Laravel! Let me know if you have any questions.
