In Laravel, traits are PHP classes that provide a reusable set of methods that can be used by multiple classes. Traits are often used to avoid code duplication and to share common functionality between classes.

Here is an example of how you might use a trait in a Laravel application:

Copy code

```php
trait Searchable {
    public function search(string $query) {
        return static::where('name', 'like', "%{$query}%")->get();
    }
}

class User extends Model {
    use Searchable;
}

class Product extends Model {
    use Searchable;
}
```

In this example, the `Searchable` trait defines a `search` method that can be used to search for records in the database based on a given query string. The `User` and `Product` models both use the `Searchable` trait, so they both have access to the `search` method.

Requests are classes that represent HTTP requests made to your application. They are typically located in the `app/Http/Requests` directory, and they can be used to validate and sanitize request data.

Here is an example of how you might use a request class in a Laravel application:

Copy code

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;

class StoreBlogPost extends FormRequest {
    public function authorize() {
        return true;
    }

    public function rules() {
        return [
            'title' => 'required|max:255',
            'body' => 'required',
        ];
    }
}
```

In this example, the `StoreBlogPost` request class defines an `authorize` method that determines whether the current user is authorized to create a new blog post, and a `rules` method that defines the validation rules for the request data.

You can then use the request class in a controller like this:

Copy code

```php
use App\Http\Requests\StoreBlogPost;

class BlogController extends Controller {
    public function store(StoreBlogPost $request) {
        // The request data has already been validated and sanitized...
    }
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
