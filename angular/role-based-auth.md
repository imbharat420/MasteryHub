**role base authentication routes in angular**

In Angular, you can implement role-based authentication by using route guards. Route guards are functions that determine whether a route can be activated or not. You can use route guards to check the user's role and decide whether to allow or deny access to a particular route.

Here's an example of how you can implement a route guard to check for a specific role in Angular:

Copy code

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, UrlTree } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class RoleGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  canActivate(
    route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    state: RouterStateSnapshot
  ): Observable<boolean | UrlTree> | Promise<boolean | UrlTree> | boolean | UrlTree {
    // Get the required role from the route data
    const requiredRole = route.data.requiredRole;

    // Get the user's role from the auth service
    const userRole = this.authService.getUserRole();

    // Return true if the user has the required role, false otherwise
    return userRole === requiredRole;
  }
}
``` 

To use this route guard, you would need to specify it in the route configuration when defining your routes. For example:

Copy code

```js
{
  path: 'admin',
  component: AdminComponent,
  canActivate: [RoleGuard],
  data: { requiredRole: 'admin' }
}
``` 

This route would only be activated if the user's role is "admin". If the user's role is not "admin", the route guard will prevent the route from being activated and the user will be redirected to a different route (or shown an error message, depending on your implementation).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
