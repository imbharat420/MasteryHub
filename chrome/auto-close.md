**auto close site on open by extension command**

To automatically close a website when it is opened by an extension, you can use the `chrome.tabs.remove` function in the Chrome Extension API. Here's an example of how you can use this function to close a tab when the extension is activated:

Copy code

```js
chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(activeInfo => {
  chrome.tabs.get(activeInfo.tabId, tab => {
    // Check if the extension is the one that opened the tab
    if (tab.openerTabId === chrome.windows.WINDOW_ID_NONE) {
      // Close the tab
      chrome.tabs.remove(activeInfo.tabId);
    }
  });
});
```

This code uses the `chrome.tabs.onActivated` event to listen for when a tab is activated (i.e. when a user switches to a different tab), and the `chrome.tabs.get` function to retrieve the details of the tab that was activated. If the tab was opened by the extension (indicated by the `openerTabId` property being `chrome.windows.WINDOW_ID_NONE`), then the tab is closed using the `chrome.tabs.remove` function.

Note that this code should be placed in the background script of your extension. You will also need to include the `tabs` permission in the extension's manifest file to allow the extension to access the `chrome.tabs` API.

Copy code

```js
{
  "permissions": ["tabs"]
}
```
