To mount a LinkedIn post title in a React app, you can use the useEffect Hook and the LinkedIn API to fetch the post data and display it in your app. Here's an example of how you might do this:

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const LinkedInPost = () => {
  const [post, setPost] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch the post data using the LinkedIn API
    fetch('https://api.linkedin.com/v2/posts/{postId}', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer {accessToken}',
      },
    })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        setPost(data);
      });
  }, []);

  // Render the post title if the data has been fetched
  return post ? (
    <h1>{post.title}</h1>
  ) : null;
}
```
This code uses the useEffect Hook to fetch the post data when the component mounts, and the useState Hook to store the data in a state variable. The post title is then rendered if the data has been fetched.

Note that this is just one way to implement this functionality, and there are many other ways you could approach it depending on your specific requirements. I hope this helps to get you started! Let me know if you have any questions.
