example of how you can use the IndexedDB API to save the data from a canvas element in a web application, and then restore it when the page is reopened:

Copy code

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

function saveCanvas(canvas) {
  // Get the canvas data as a base64-encoded string
  const data = canvas.toDataURL();

  // Open a database transaction and get the canvas object store
  const transaction = window.indexedDB
    .open("canvas")
    .transaction(["canvas"], "readwrite");
  const store = transaction.objectStore("canvas");

  // Put the canvas data in the object store
  store.put(data, "canvasData");
}

function loadCanvas(canvas) {
  // Open a database transaction and get the canvas object store
  const transaction = window.indexedDB
    .open("canvas")
    .transaction(["canvas"], "readonly");
  const store = transaction.objectStore("canvas");

  // Get the canvas data from the object store
  store.get("canvasData").onsuccess = event => {
    // Set the canvas data from the database
    const data = event.target.result;
    const context = canvas.getContext("2d");
    const image = new Image();
    image.src = data;
    image.onload = () => {
      context.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
    };
  };
}

function Canvas() {
  const canvasRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Save the canvas data to the database when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      saveCanvas(canvasRef.current);
    };
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Load the canvas data from the database when the component mounts
    loadCanvas(canvasRef.current);
  }, []);

  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
}

export default Canvas;
```

This example uses the `useEffect` hook to perform the save and load operations when the component mounts and unmounts, respectively. The `canvasRef` is used to store a reference to the canvas element, which is then passed to the `saveCanvas` and `loadCanvas` functions.

The `saveCanvas` function gets the data from the canvas element as a base64-encoded string, and then it stores it in the IndexedDB database using the `put` method of the object store.

The `loadCanvas` function retrieves the canvas data from the database using the `get` method of the object store, and then it sets the data on the canvas element by creating an image from the data and drawing it on the canvas.

This is just one way to save and restore canvas data using IndexedDB, but there are many other approaches you could take as well.
