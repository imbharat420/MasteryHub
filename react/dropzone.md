**dropzone on window in reactjs**

Dropzone is a popular library for handling file uploads in JavaScript. Here's an example of how you can use Dropzone in a React component:

Copy code

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import Dropzone from 'dropzone';

function MyDropzone() {
  const dropzoneRef = useRef(null);

  const configureDropzone = () => {
    const dropzoneElement = dropzoneRef.current;
    if (dropzoneElement) {
      // configure Dropzone
      Dropzone.autoDiscover = false;
      new Dropzone(dropzoneElement, {
        url: '/upload',
        maxFiles: 1
      });
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={dropzoneRef} id="dropzone">
        Drop files here
      </div>
      <button onClick={configureDropzone}>Configure Dropzone</button>
    </div>
  );
}` 
```
In this example, we're using the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the `div` element that will be used as the Dropzone. When the "Configure Dropzone" button is clicked, we use this reference to create a new Dropzone instance and configure it.

You can customize the Dropzone by passing different options to the Dropzone constructor. For example, you can specify the URL to which the files will be uploaded, the maximum number of files that can be uploaded, and more.

For more information on using Dropzone in React, you can check out the Dropzone documentation or the React documentation on working with refs.



**make a dropzone hook for drop file in body Reactjs**

Here's an example of how you can create a custom hook for using Dropzone in React:

Copy code

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import Dropzone from 'dropzone';

function useDropzone(options) {
  const dropzoneRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const dropzoneElement = dropzoneRef.current;
    if (dropzoneElement) {
      new Dropzone(dropzoneElement, options);
    }
  }, [options]);

  return (
    <div ref={dropzoneRef}>
      Drop files here
    </div>
  );
}

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      {useDropzone({
        url: '/upload',
        maxFiles: 1
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This hook will render a `div` element that can be used as a Dropzone, and it will configure the Dropzone using the options that are passed in.

To use this hook, you can simply call it inside your component and pass in the desired Dropzone options. The hook will return the Dropzone element, which you can then use in your component's render method.

You can customize this hook further by adding additional functionality, such as handling file events or displaying a preview of the uploaded files. You can also pass in a ref to the Dropzone element as an argument to the hook if you need to access the Dropzone instance directly.
