The `useEffect` hook is a function that takes two arguments: a function to run when the component renders or re-renders (the "effect"), and an array of values that determine when the effect should run (the "dependencies"). The effect function is called after the component renders, and it can be used to perform side effects, such as fetching data or updating the DOM. The dependencies array is optional, and it determines when the effect function should be called again. If the dependencies array is not provided, the effect function will be called every time the component re-renders.

If you want to create a `useEffect` cleanup hook, you can return a function from the effect function. This function will be called when the component is about to unmount or when the dependencies change, and it can be used to perform any necessary cleanup.

Here's an example of a `useEffect` hook with a cleanup function:

Copy code

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // This function will be called when the component mounts
    console.log("Component mounted");

    // Return a function that will be called when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      console.log("Component unmounted");
    };
  }, []); // No dependencies, so the effect function will only be called once
}
```

In this example, the `useEffect` hook is called with an effect function that logs a message when the component mounts, and a cleanup function that logs a message when the component unmounts. The effect function will only be called once, because the dependencies array is empty. If you want the effect function to be called again when the component re-renders, you can include dependencies in the array, and the effect function will be called whenever the dependencies change.
