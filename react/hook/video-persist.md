To create a React hook for a mini audio and video player in React that does not stop the audio and video elements when navigating to a different page, you can use the `useEffect` hook to implement a technique called "persistent playback". This involves storing the current time and the state (playing or paused) of the audio and video elements in a cookie or local storage, and restoring these values when the page is loaded.

Here is an example of a custom hook called `usePersistentPlayback` that implements persistent playback using local storage:

Copy code

```js
import { useEffect } from "react";

function usePersistentPlayback(player) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Save the current time and state of the player in local storage
    window.addEventListener("beforeunload", function () {
      localStorage.setItem("currentTime", player.currentTime);
      localStorage.setItem("paused", player.paused);
    });

    // Restore the current time and state of the player when the page is loaded
    window.addEventListener("load", function () {
      player.currentTime = localStorage.getItem("currentTime") || 0;
      player.paused = localStorage.getItem("paused") || false;
    });
  }, [player]);
}
```

To use this hook, you can pass the `audio` or `video` element as an argument when calling the hook. For example:

Copy code

```js
import { usePersistentPlayback } from "./usePersistentPlayback";

function MyPlayer() {
  const player = useRef(null);
  usePersistentPlayback(player.current);

  return <audio ref={player} src="audio.mp3"></audio>;
}
```

This will cause the audio or video to continue playing from the same point where it was left off, even when the user navigates to a different page and then comes back.

You can then add controls such as play/pause buttons and a volume slider to allow the user to control the audio and video playback.

Here is an example of a mini audio player using the `usePersistentPlayback` hook:

Copy code

```js
import { usePersistentPlayback } from "./usePersistentPlayback";

function MyAudioPlayer() {
  const player = useRef(null);
  usePersistentPlayback(player.current);

  return (
    <>
      <audio ref={player} src="audio.mp3"></audio>
      <button onClick={() => player.current.play()}>Play</button>
      <button onClick={() => player.current.pause()}>Pause</button>
      <input
        type="range"
        min="0"
        max="1"
        step="0.1"
        onChange={event => (player.current.volume = event.target.value)}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

And here is an example of a mini video player using the `usePersistentPlayback` hook:
