**react component for image upload and show as blob**

Here is an example of a React component that allows a user to upload an image file and display it as a blob.

First, we'll create a simple form with a file input field and a submit button:

Copy code

```js
import React from 'react';

function ImageUploadForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input type="file" accept="image/*" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Next, we'll add a state variable to hold the selected image file and a method to handle the submission of the form:

Copy code


```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ImageUploadForm() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState(null);

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // submit the form
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="file" accept="image/*" onChange={(event) => setImage(event.target.files[0])} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Finally, we'll use the `FileReader` API to read the selected image file as a blob, and display it using an `img` element:

Copy code

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ImageUploadForm() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState(null);
  const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState(null);

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = () => {
      setImageUrl(reader.result);
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(image);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input type="file" accept="image/*" onChange={(event) => setImage(event.target.files[0])} />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
      {imageUrl && <img src={imageUrl} alt="Selected image" />}
    </div>
  );
}
``` 

This is just a basic example, but it should give you an idea of how to build a React component for uploading and displaying an image as a blob. You can customize the component by adding additional features or validation, such as checking the file size or type before allowing the user to submit the form.
