**bubbling hook in reactjs**

In React, the term "bubbling" refers to the way that events propagate through the component tree. When an event is triggered on a child component, it will bubble up to its parent, and then to the parent's parent, and so on, until it reaches the root of the tree. This is known as "event bubbling."

There is no built-in "bubbling hook" in React, but you can use the useEffect hook to listen for events that bubble up to a specific component. Here is an example of how you can use the useEffect hook to listen for a click event that bubbles up to a parent component:

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function ParentComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleClick = (event) => {
      console.log('Parent component received click event');
    };

    window.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent() {
  return (
    <button>Click me</button>
  );
}

```

In this example, the useEffect hook is used to listen for click events on the window object. When a click event is triggered on the ChildComponent button, it will bubble up to the window object and trigger the event listener in the ParentComponent.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
