When debugging WebRTC in code, you can use various techniques such as adding log statements, using debugging tools, and testing with different configurations.

Here are some tips for debugging WebRTC in code:

1.  Add log statements: Insert log statements throughout your code to print out relevant information, such as the state of variables and the progress of the WebRTC connection.
    
2.  Use a debugging tool: Use a debugging tool like `console.log()` or `console.debug()` for printing out the log statements.
    
3.  Test with different configurations: Test your WebRTC application with different network configurations, such as varying the video resolution or using different codecs.
    
4.  Use the browser's dev tool like chrome dev tool, firefox dev tool to inspect the webrtc connection and see the logs.
    
5.  Use chrome://webrtc-internals/ for more deep debugging and troubleshooting.
    
6.  Use webrtc-debugging-node library for debugging in nodejs.
    

It's important to check the WebRTC documentation, forums and the library's documentation for troubleshooting specific issues, best practices and to see if there are any known bugs that are similar to the one you are experiencing.







When debugging WebRTC on Chrome, you can use the browser's developer tools to inspect the WebRTC connection and see detailed logs. Here are some steps to follow:

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to the WebRTC application you want to debug.
    
2.  Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press "Ctrl+Shift+I"
    
3.  Click on the "Network" tab and filter the logs by "webrtc"
    
4.  Click on the PeerConnection item to see detailed information about the WebRTC connection, such as the ICE connection state, the negotiated codecs, and the ICE candidates.
    
5.  Use the "Console" tab to view any error messages or warnings related to the WebRTC connection.
    
6.  Use chrome://webrtc-internals/ for more deep debugging and troubleshooting.
    

It's also important to check the WebRTC documentation and forums for troubleshooting specific issues and to check the browser's version and update it if possible.
