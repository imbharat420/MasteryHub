**Send mouse coordinates with data channels**

To send mouse coordinates using data channels, you can follow these steps:

1.  Create a new RTCPeerConnection object to establish a connection between the two devices.
2.  Use the `createDataChannel` method on the RTCPeerConnection object to create a new data channel for sending and receiving data.
3.  Add an event listener for the `message` event on the data channel to handle incoming messages.
4.  To send the mouse coordinates, you can use the `send` method on the data channel and pass it a string or JSON object containing the coordinates.

Here is an example of how you could implement this in JavaScript:

Copy code

```js
// Create a new RTCPeerConnection object
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();

// Create a new data channel
const dataChannel = peerConnection.createDataChannel('mouse-coordinates');

// Add an event listener for the 'message' event on the data channel
dataChannel.addEventListener('message', event => {
  // Handle incoming message
  const message = event.data;
  console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);
});

// Send the mouse coordinates
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify({x: 100, y: 200}));`` 
```
Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and there are many other considerations you should take into account when using data channels, such as error handling and signaling to establish the connection.
