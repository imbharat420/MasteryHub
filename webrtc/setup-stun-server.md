**how to create stun server**

To create a STUN server, you will need to do the following:

1.  Install the necessary software. You will need to install a STUN server implementation such as coturn or reTurn. These can be installed using a package manager on your operating system or compiled from source.
2.  Configure the STUN server. You will need to edit the configuration file for the STUN server to specify the IP address and port that the server will listen on, as well as any other desired settings such as authentication credentials or network interfaces to bind to.
3.  Start the STUN server. Once the STUN server is installed and configured, you can start it by running the appropriate command in your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Test the STUN server. You can use a tool such as STUNTMAN or a web-based STUN client to test that your STUN server is working correctly.

It's important to note that STUN servers are typically used in conjunction with other types of servers, such as TURN servers, to provide complete communication between two parties behind NAT devices.
