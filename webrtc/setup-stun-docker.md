**You can use Docker to run a STUN server in a containerized environment. Here are the steps you can follow to do this:**

1.  Install Docker on your machine. If you don't already have Docker installed, you can download and install it from the official Docker website.
2.  Pull the STUN server image. You can use the `docker pull` command to pull a pre-built STUN server image from a registry such as Docker Hub. For example, to pull the coturn image, you can use the following command:

Copy code

`docker pull alpine/coturn`

3.  Create a Docker container for the STUN server. Use the `docker run` command to create a new container for the STUN server image. You will need to specify the image name, as well as any desired configuration options such as port mappings or environment variables.
4.  Start the STUN server. Once the container is created, you can use the `docker start` command to start the STUN server.
5.  Test the STUN server. You can use a tool such as STUNTMAN or a web-based STUN client to test that your STUN server is working correctly.

Here's an example of how you might use the `docker run` command to create a container for the coturn STUN server:

Copy code

`docker run -d --name stun-server -p 3478:3478/udp alpine/coturn`

This will create a new container named "stun-server" that runs the coturn image and exposes the STUN server on port 3478. The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode, and the `--name` flag specifies the container name. The `-p` flag maps the container's port 3478 to the host's port 3478.
