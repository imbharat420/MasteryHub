# RabbitMQ is a popular open-source message-broker software that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It allows applications to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages.

# Here is a very basic program that demonstrates how to send and receive messages using RabbitMQ:

import pika

# establish a connection to the RabbitMQ server
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

# create a queue to which the message will be delivered
channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')

# send a message
channel.basic_publish(exchange='',
                      routing_key='hello',
                      body='Hello, World!')
print(" [x] Sent 'Hello, World!'")

# close the connection
connection.close()


# This program establishes a connection to a local RabbitMQ server, creates a queue called "hello", and sends a message with the body "Hello, World!" to that queue.

# To receive messages, you can use the following code:

import pika

# establish a connection to the RabbitMQ server
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

# create a queue to which the message will be delivered
channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')

# function to be called when a message is received
def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(" [x] Received %r" % body)

# set up a consumer that will call the 'callback' function when a message is received
channel.basic_consume(queue='hello',
                      on_message_callback=callback,
                      auto_ack=True)

# wait for messages
print(' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C')
channel.start_consuming()


# This program creates a consumer that listens for messages on the "hello" queue, and calls the callback function each time a message is received. In this case, the callback function simply prints the body of the received message.

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
