**example for LRUCacheNode**

LRUCacheNode is a data structure that represents a node in a linked list used to implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. An LRU cache is a type of cache that has a fixed maximum capacity and discards the least recently used items when the capacity is reached. The idea behind the LRU cache is that the items that are used most frequently are the ones that should be kept in the cache, while the least frequently used items can be discarded to make room for new items.

Here is an example of an LRUCacheNode class in Python:

Copy code

```py
class LRUCacheNode:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None
```
This class has four instance variables:

-   `key`: the key associated with the cached item
-   `value`: the value of the cached item
-   `next`: a reference to the next node in the linked list
-   `prev`: a reference to the previous node in the linked list

The `next` and `prev` variables are used to link the nodes together in a doubly linked list, which is typically used to implement an LRU cache.

Here is an example of how you might use the LRUCacheNode class to create a node and add it to a linked list:

Copy code

```py
node1 = LRUCacheNode(1, "value1")
node2 = LRUCacheNode(2, "value2")

node1.next = node2
node2.prev = node1` 
```
This creates two nodes with keys 1 and 2, and values "value1" and "value2", respectively. The `next` and `prev` variables are used to link the two nodes together in a doubly linked list.
