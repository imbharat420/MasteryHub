To unzip a zip folder from Google Drive and save the extracted files back to Google Drive using the Drive API in Google Colab, you can use the following script:

1.  First, you will need to install the Google API client library and authenticate your Google account. You can do this by running the following commands:

Copy code

`!pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client

from google.colab import auth
auth.authenticate_user()`

2.  Next, you can use the `drive_service` object to list the files in your Google Drive and find the file that you want to unzip. You can use the `files().list()` method to get a list of all the files in your Drive, and then filter the list by the file name or file ID.

Copy code

`from googleapiclient.discovery import build

service = build("drive", "v3")
results = service.files().list(q="name='zip-folder.zip'", fields="nextPageToken, files(id, name)").execute()
items = results.get("files", [])

if not items:
print("No files found.")
else:
for item in items:
print(f"{item['name']} ({item['id']})")`

3.  Once you have the ID of the zip folder, you can use the `drive_service` object to download the file and unzip it using the `zipfile` module. You can then use the `os` module to create a new folder in your Google Drive to save the extracted files.

Copy code

```py
import io
import zipfile
import googleapiclient.http
import os

zip_folder_id = items[0]['id']
request = service.files().get_media(fileId=zip_folder_id)
zip_folder = io.BytesIO(request.execute())

zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(zip_folder, 'r')
zip_ref.extractall()
zip_ref.close()

folder_name = "extracted-folder"
try:
    # Create the folder
    folder_metadata = {"name": folder_name, "mimeType": "application/vnd.google-apps.folder"}
    folder = service.files().create(body=folder_metadata, fields="id").execute()
    print(F'Folder has been created with Name "{folder_name}" and URL: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder.get("id")}".')
except HttpError as error:
    print(F'An error occurred while creating the folder: {error}')
    folder = None
```

4.  Finally, you can use the `drive_service` object to upload the extracted files to the new folder in your Google Drive. You can use the `os` module to list the files in the current working directory, and then use the `drive_service.files().create()` method to upload each file to the folder.

Copy code

```py
for file_name in os.listdir():
    file_metadata = {"name": file_name, "parents": [folder['id']]}
    media = googleapiclient.http.MediaFileUpload(file_name, mimetype='
     `media = googleapiclient.http.MediaFileUpload(file_name, mimetype='application/octet-stream', resumable=True)
    file = service.files().create(body=file_metadata, media_body=media, fields="id").execute()
    print(F'File {file_name} has been added to the folder with URL: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder.get("id")}".')
```

This code uses the `googleapiclient.http.MediaFileUpload` class to upload the file to Google Drive, and the `service.files().create()` method to create a new file in the specified folder. The `mimetype` parameter specifies the MIME type of the file, and the `resumable` parameter indicates that the upload can be resumed if it is interrupted.
