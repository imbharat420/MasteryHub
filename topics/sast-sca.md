Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) are tools that are used to find security vulnerabilities in software.

SAST tools are designed to analyze the source code of a software application to identify security vulnerabilities. They typically work by parsing the source code, building a representation of the code in memory, and then using a set of rules or algorithms to identify vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection vulnerabilities, and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

SCA tools are designed to identify vulnerabilities that are introduced into a software application through the use of third-party libraries or components. They work by scanning the dependencies of a software application, identifying the libraries and components that are used, and then checking a database of known vulnerabilities to see if any of the dependencies contain known vulnerabilities.

Both SAST and SCA tools use a variety of algorithms and techniques to analyze software and identify vulnerabilities. Some common algorithms and techniques include:

- Regular expressions: These are used to identify patterns in the source code that may indicate a vulnerability, such as the use of certain functions or the inclusion of certain keywords.
- Data flow analysis: This involves analyzing the flow of data through the program to identify potential vulnerabilities. For example, a SAST tool may track how user input is handled and used to identify potential injection vulnerabilities.
- Control flow analysis: This involves analyzing the control flow of the program, such as the sequence of function calls and the branching of control statements, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Machine learning: Some tools use machine learning algorithms to identify vulnerabilities based on patterns in the source code.

These are just a few examples of the algorithms and techniques that may be used by SAST and SCA tools. There are many other algorithms and techniques that may be used, and the specific algorithms and techniques used by a given tool will depend on the tool itself and the types of vulnerabilities that it is designed to identify.
