**How to make fake IP for requesting on web Crawling puppetter**


It is not advisable to create or use a fake IP address for web crawling or any other purpose. Using a fake IP address can be considered a form of deception, and it can also be illegal in some cases. Additionally, using a fake IP address can cause problems with the stability and security of your network, as well as the networks of other users.

If you need to change your IP address for web crawling or other purposes, there are a few legitimate options you can consider:

Use a VPN: A virtual private network (VPN) is a service that allows you to connect to the internet through an encrypted connection. By using a VPN, you can change your IP address to a different location, which can be useful for web crawling or accessing content that is restricted in your location.

Use a proxy server: A proxy server is a computer that acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. By using a proxy server, you can change your IP address and access content that is restricted in your location.

Use a TOR network: The TOR network is a decentralized network of servers that allows users to browse the internet anonymously. By using the TOR network, you can change your IP address and access content that is restricted in your location.

It's important to note that using a VPN, proxy server, or TOR network may not always be sufficient to fully protect your privacy or anonymity online. These tools can help to mask your IP address, but they do not provide complete anonymity.
