There are a few ways you can hide frontend server files from sources:

1.  Use a backend server to serve the frontend files: Instead of serving the frontend files directly from the frontend server, you can use a backend server to serve the files. This can be done by making an HTTP request from the backend server to the frontend server to retrieve the frontend files and then returning the files to the client. This way, the frontend files are not directly accessible to the client, and the client can only access the files through the backend server.
2.  Use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve the frontend files: A CDN is a network of servers that are distributed geographically and are used to deliver content, such as frontend files, to users based on their location. By serving the frontend files through a CDN, you can hide the location of the frontend server and make it more difficult for users to access the files directly.
3.  Use client-side rendering: Instead of serving the frontend files from a server, you can use client-side rendering to generate the frontend content on the client side. This can be done using technologies such as JavaScript and AJAX, which allow the client to request and receive data from the server without reloading the page. By using client-side rendering, you can hide the frontend server and the frontend files from the client.

Keep in mind that these methods are not foolproof and may not provide complete security. It is always important to secure your servers and protect your files from unauthorized access. You should consider using additional security measures, such as firewalls and encryption, to further secure your servers and protect your data.
