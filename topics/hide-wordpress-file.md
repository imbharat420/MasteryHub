There are a few ways you can hide the fact that your server is using WordPress:

1.  Use a security plugin: There are several WordPress security plugins that can help you hide the fact that your site is using WordPress. These plugins often have features that allow you to remove WordPress version numbers and other identifying information from the source code of your site.
2.  Customize your site's footer: You can remove the "Powered by WordPress" link from the footer of your site by modifying the code in your theme's footer.php file.
3.  Use a security plugin to block access to certain WordPress files: Some security plugins allow you to block access to certain WordPress files, such as the readme.html file and the wp-config-sample.php file.
