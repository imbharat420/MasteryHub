**Rotating IP in nodejs for web scrapping without third party ip provider**

There are a few different ways you can rotate IP addresses when performing web scraping in Node.js without using a third-party IP provider:

Use a rotating proxy service: Some services offer a pool of proxies that you can use, and they will automatically rotate the IP address for you as you make requests. This can be a convenient way to rotate IPs without having to manage the rotation yourself.

Use a local proxy: You can set up a local proxy server on your own machine, such as Privoxy or Polipo, and use this proxy to make requests through different IP addresses. You can then rotate the IP address by changing the proxy configuration or by using a different proxy server.

Use a virtual private network (VPN): Another option is to use a VPN service, which can allow you to make requests through a different IP address by routing your traffic through a different network. This can be a good option if you want to rotate IPs more frequently or if you need to use a specific location or type of IP.

It's important to note that rotating IPs may not always be necessary when web scraping, and it can depend on the specific website and the type of data you are trying to access. In some cases, using a single IP address and respecting the website's terms of service and rate limits may be sufficient. It's also important to consider any legal or ethical implications of your web scraping activities, as well as any potential impact on the performance and security of the website.
