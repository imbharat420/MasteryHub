**example regex for beginner to advance**

Here are some example regular expressions that may be useful for beginners to advanced users:

1.  Basic matching:

-   `^\d+$`: This regular expression matches a string that consists only of one or more digits (0-9). The `^` and `$` symbols anchor the match to the start and end of the string, respectively, so the entire string must match the pattern.
    
-   `[A-Za-z]`: This regular expression matches any single alphabetical character, upper or lower case.
    
-   `\bcat\b`: This regular expression matches the word "cat" as a standalone word, surrounded by word boundaries.
    

2.  Quantifiers:

-   `a{3,5}`: This regular expression matches the letter "a" repeated three to five times.
    
-   `\d{2,}`: This regular expression matches two or more digits in a row.
    
-   `\w{3,}`: This regular expression matches three or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores) in a row.
    

3.  Grouping and alternation:

-   `(cat|dog)`: This regular expression matches either the word "cat" or the word "dog".
    
-   `\b(cat|dog|mouse)\b`: This regular expression matches any of the words "cat", "dog", or "mouse" as standalone words.
    
-   `\b(cat|dog)s?\b`: This regular expression matches the words "cat" or "dog", optionally followed by the letter "s".
    

4.  Advanced matching:

-   `\b\d{1,2}[a-z]{2}\b`: This regular expression matches a string that starts and ends with a word boundary, and consists of one or two digits followed by two lowercase letters.
    
-   `^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}$`: This regular expression matches an email address. It uses a combination of character classes, quantifiers, and grouping to ensure that the address is in the correct format.
