Here are the steps you can follow to create an API for sending files to a shared drive from a Telegram group:

1.  First, you will need to create a bot in Telegram and get the bot's API token. You can do this by talking to the BotFather bot and following the instructions it gives you.
2.  Next, you will need to install the python-telegram-bot library and use it to create a bot that can listen for messages in the group and respond to commands. You can do this by following the tutorial at [https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
3.  Once you have a working Telegram bot, you will need to use the Google Drive API to access and modify the shared drive. You can find the documentation for the Google Drive API at [https://developers.google.com/drive](https://developers.google.com/drive).
4.  To authenticate your bot to use the Google Drive API, you will need to create a project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Google Drive API for that project. Then you will need to create an OAuth 2.0 client ID and download the JSON file with the client secrets. You can find instructions for this process at [https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred).
5.  With the client secrets file, you can use the google-auth and google-auth-oauthlib libraries to authenticate your bot and authorize it to access the Google Drive API.
6.  Once you have authenticated your bot and authorized it to access the Google Drive API, you can use the google-api-python-client library to call the API and perform actions such as uploading files to the shared drive.
