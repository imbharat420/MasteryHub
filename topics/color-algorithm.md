There are a few different approaches you can take to create a palette of colors that work well together. Here are a few options:

1.  Monochromatic palette: This involves selecting a single hue and creating a palette using various shades and tints of that hue. To create a monochromatic palette, you can use a color wheel to choose a base hue, then use a tool like Adobe Color to generate shades and tints of that hue.
    
2.  Analogous palette: This involves selecting three or four hues that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. These hues will naturally harmonize with each other and create a cohesive palette.
    
3.  Complementary palette: This involves selecting two hues that are opposite each other on the color wheel. These hues will create a high-contrast palette that can be used to create a bold and dynamic look.
    
4.  Triadic palette: This involves selecting three hues that are equally spaced around the color wheel. This creates a palette with a balanced distribution of hues.
    

No matter which approach you take, it's important to consider the purpose of the palette and the overall aesthetic you want to achieve. You may also want to consider the characteristics of the hues you select, such as their saturation and value, to ensure that the palette is visually appealing and easy to read.
