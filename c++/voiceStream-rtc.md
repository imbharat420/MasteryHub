To stream audio over an RTC (Real-Time Communication) connection using C++, you will need to use a library that implements the WebRTC API. One such library is the WebRTC Native C++ API, which is part of the WebRTC project.

Here is an example of how you might use the WebRTC Native C++ API to create and use an RTC audio stream:

1.  First, you will need to include the necessary headers and namespaces:

Copy code

```cpp
#include "api/peer_connection_interface.h"
#include "api/create_peerconnection_factory.h"
#include "api/audio_codecs/builtin_audio_decoder_factory.h"
#include "api/audio_codecs/builtin_audio_encoder_factory.h"

using namespace webrtc;

```

2.  Next, you will need to create a PeerConnectionFactory and a PeerConnection. The PeerConnectionFactory is used to create PeerConnection objects, which are used to establish connections with other peers. The PeerConnection is used to send and receive audio streams.

Copy code

````cpp
rtc::scoped_refptr<PeerConnectionFactoryInterface> factory =
    CreatePeerConnectionFactory(rtc::Thread::Current(),
                                rtc::Thread::Current(),
                                rtc::Thread::Current(),
                                rtc::scoped_refptr<AudioDecoderFactory>(
                                    CreateBuiltinAudioDecoderFactory()),
                                rtc::scoped_refptr<AudioEncoderFactory>(
                                    CreateBuiltinAudioEncoderFactory()),
                                nullptr /* audio_mixer */,
                                nullptr /* audio_processing */);

rtc::scoped_refptr<PeerConnectionInterface> pc =
    factory->CreatePeerConnection(config, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
    ```
````

3.  Next, you will need to create an audio track and add it to the PeerConnection. An audio track represents a stream of audio that can be sent and received over the PeerConnection.

Copy code

```cpp
rtc::scoped_refptr<AudioTrackInterface> audio_track =
    factory->CreateAudioTrack("audio_track", factory->CreateAudioSource(config));

pc->AddTrack(audio_track, { "stream_id" });
```

4.  Finally, you can use the PeerConnection to establish a connection
