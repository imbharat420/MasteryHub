**Examples for SQL all clauses and types**

SQL is a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. It consists of several clauses and types that can be used to perform various tasks such as querying data, modifying data, and controlling access to the database. Here are some examples of common clauses and types in SQL:

1.  SELECT clause: This is used to retrieve data from a database table. For example:

Copy code

`SELECT * FROM Customers;` 

This statement retrieves all columns and rows from the Customers table.

2.  WHERE clause: This is used to filter the results of a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement based on specific criteria. For example:

Copy code

`SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA';` 

This statement retrieves all rows from the Customers table where the Country column is 'USA'.

3.  JOIN clause: This is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. For example:

Copy code

`SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;` 

This statement retrieves the CustomerName and OrderDate columns from the Customers and Orders tables and combines them based on the CustomerID column.

4.  GROUP BY clause: This is used to group the results of a SELECT statement by one or more columns. For example:

Copy code

`SELECT COUNT(*) as NumOrders, Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;` 

This statement counts the number of orders for each country and groups the results by country.

5.  ORDER BY clause: This is used to sort the results of a SELECT statement by one or more columns. For example:

Copy code

`SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;` 

This statement retrieves all rows from the Customers table and sorts them first by Country in ascending order and then by CustomerName in descending order.

6.  Data types: These define the type of data that a column can store in a database table. Some common data types include INTEGER, VARCHAR, and DATE. For example:

Copy code

`CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(255),
    Country VARCHAR(255),
    BirthDate DATE
);` 

This statement creates a Customers table with a CustomerID column of type INTEGER, a CustomerName column of type VARCHAR, a Country column of type VARCHAR, and a BirthDate column of type DATE.
