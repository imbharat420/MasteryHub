To create a mini audio and video player on a React Navigation page, you can use the `react-native-video` library for playing video and the `react-native-sound` library for playing audio.

First, install the libraries by running the following command:

Copy code

```bash
npm install react-native-video react-native-sound
```

Then, import the `Video` component from `react-native-video` and the `Sound` component from `react-native-sound` in your React component:

Copy code

```jsx
import { Video } from "react-native-video";
import { Sound } from "react-native-sound";
```

Next, add the `Video` and `Sound` components to your JSX code. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the player by setting various props such as `source`, `paused`, `volume`, and `onEnd`.

Here is an example of a mini audio player:

Copy code

```jsx
<Sound
  source={{ uri: "audio.mp3" }}
  paused={this.state.paused}
  onEnd={this.handleSongEnd}
  volume={this.state.volume}
/>
```

And here is an example of a mini video player:

Copy code

```jsx
<Video
  source={{ uri: "video.mp4" }}
  paused={this.state.paused}
  onEnd={this.handleVideoEnd}
  volume={this.state.volume}
/>
```

You can then add controls such as play/pause buttons and a volume slider to allow the user to control the audio and video playback.

Note that the `react-native-video` library only works in a React Native environment, and will not work in a regular web browser. If you are building a web application and want to play audio and video, you can use the `audio` and `video` elements in HTML as described in my previous responses.
